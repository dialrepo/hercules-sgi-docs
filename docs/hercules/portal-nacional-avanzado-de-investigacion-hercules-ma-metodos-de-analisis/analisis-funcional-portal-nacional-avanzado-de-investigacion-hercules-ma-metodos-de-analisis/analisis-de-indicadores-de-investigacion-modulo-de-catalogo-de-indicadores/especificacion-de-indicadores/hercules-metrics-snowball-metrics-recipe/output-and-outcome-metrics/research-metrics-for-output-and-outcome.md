#### h\-index

To define:

* h\-index. To quote from this paper that defines the h\-index in terms of researchers: “A scientist has index h if h of his or her Np papers have at least h citations each and the other (Np – h) papers have ≤h citations each. In other words, a group of papers has an h\-index of 17 if 17 of these papers have each received at least 17 citations, and 18 of these papers have not each received at least 18 citations.

#### Field\-Weighted Citation Impact

To define:

* Field\-Weighted Citation Impact. It's the ratio of the citations actually received by the denominator’s output, and the average number of citations received by all other similar publications
	+ Exactly 1\.00 means that the output performs just as expected for the global average.
	+ More than 1\.00 means that the output is more cited than expected according to the global average; for example, 1\.48 means 48% more cited than expected.
	+ Less than 1 means that the output is cited less than expected according to the global average; for example, 0\.91 means 9% less cited than expected
* Professor. What's a professor?

### Collaboration

#### Collaboration

To define:

* National co\-authorship. it has an affiliation that does not belong to the parent institution but is within the parent institution’s country.
* International co\-authorship. it has an affiliation that does not belong to the parent institution and is outside the parent institution’s country. An output that has both national and international co\-authorships will be classified as international, to avoid double counting.

#### Collaboration Publication Share

To define:

* Collaboration partner. Depending on the partner, the user and privacy could change to add users from "Staff from public administration" and "Restricted" privacy. E.g.: a university could share how much it collaborates with a group of universities of which it is part (Campus Mare Nostrum, Iberus) with the universities that make up that group.
